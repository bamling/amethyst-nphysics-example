# amethyst-nphysics-example

Simple example *"game"* illustrating how an integration of [nphysics](https://www.nphysics.org/)  into [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/) could look like. This example uses the `master` version of Amethyst and has all the nphysics related logic abstracted away in a separate crate (`game_physics`).
